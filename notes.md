/* Sunday Notes:

	Goals for Sunday:
		- Only Put Controllers that directly affect the table into the main function/class
		- Move any data validation and form handling outside of the main function/class
		- Maybe remove things from the DOM a little lighter than looping through everything over and over

	Other Ideas
		- Redo it in jQuery
*/

/*

General Notes for people poking around this code:

My goal was was to make an object with methods that handles
interacting with the table much easier.

I can alter this to be a jQuery plugin where the target container has a complete table
inserted by the plugin.
